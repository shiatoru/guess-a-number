# Guess a number
Simple piece of software which allows the user to guess a number between 1 and 100. Uses PySimpleGUI.

## Description
Once you run the program, a window will pop up and ask you to put a number between 1 and 100 in the text field. Press on the OK button to confirm your
number. If you don't guess the number right, a new window will appear and give you a hint for figuring out the target number. Once you guess the right
number, the amount of tries it took you will show up in a new window and pressing OK will stop the program.
